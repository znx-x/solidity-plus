# Solidity+

Solidity+ is a little fun project where I'm trying to create a superset language for Solidity with a special compiler for extended Solidity files, or `.xsol` files built using basic shell scripting for logic and processing.

With a slightly different syntax, `.xsol` files offer extended functions and an overall easier and more powerful way around coding smart contracts.

This is literally a "when I feel like" type of side project, so gauge your expectations. I intend to create either a `ts` or a `cli` app so users can deploy their `.xsol` contracts on chain.

Non-functional at the moment, but as soon as I feel that I've got to the point where it can be used - even if on a very basic form - I will build and release the compiler.

Documentation and more information will be added as the project develops, and if you need any further info just come and talk to me directly.
