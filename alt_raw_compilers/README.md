# Alternative Compilers

This folder contains alternative compilers in `C`, `C++`, `Rust`, and `Go` for Solidity+. These are "raw" compiler files, meaning that the Solidity+ superset has not been added to neither one yet. Once the final version of the main compiler in `Shell` and `Batchfile` is complete, I will then add the superset to these alternative compilers to enhance compatibility.
